# Project-1-Late-Parcel-Delivery
- This is a collaborative project as requirement to graduate from a Data science bootcamp.
- Contributed to EDA, data pre-processing, modelling and evaluation.
- Built a predictive model to increase delivery performance & minimize the potential loss of revenue.
- Focused on recall to avoid incorrectly predicting parcels that are late but marked as delivered on time.
- The model is trained by using 5 algorithms, such as Logistic regression, Decision tree, Random forest, KNN, SVC, and XGBoost.
- Decision Tree algorithm with hyper-parameters tuning has a good balance between its score, also neither underfitting nor overfitting.
